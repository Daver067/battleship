# battleship

This battleship app is intended to be written following TDD. I will be writing unit tests first, and then writing code to pass those tests.
All of the game logic will be written prior to implementing any kind of user interface.

I will be using webpack, and integrating jest into webpack.

Had an issue changing jest from using require to using standard ECMA import export.
Followed instructions on the following stack overflow question to resolve this issue.
